The project showcases how to leverage AWS services within a Java Spring Boot application. It demonstrates the following functionalities:

## Utilizing AWS SQS Queue for asynchronous messaging.
Integrating Elastic Redis Cache for caching data.

Interacting with AWS S3 for storing and retrieving objects.

**AWS Services Used**

Amazon SQS Queue: Used for asynchronous communication between components of the application, ensuring reliable and scalable message delivery.

Amazon Elastic Redis Cache: Employed for caching frequently accessed data, enhancing application performance and reducing latency.

Amazon S3: Utilized for storing and retrieving various types of objects such as images, documents, and other files securely and scalably.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

## Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
Maven or Gradle installed for building the project.

AWS account with access credentials and appropriate permissions for using SQS, Elastic Redis Cache, and S3.

AWS SDK for Java configured with your AWS credentials.

Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Configure your AWS credentials and region in the AWS SDK for Java configuration file.

Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
Usage
Follow these steps to run the application:

## Start the Spring Boot application.
Ensure that AWS SQS Queue, Elastic Redis Cache, and S3 resources are properly configured and accessible.

Test the functionality by sending messages to the SQS Queue, caching data in Elastic Redis Cache, and uploading/downloading objects from S3.
